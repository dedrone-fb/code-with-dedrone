### Quarkus/Maven example - development workflow

This repository contains a basic Quarkus/Maven project. The tasks are

* checkout this project from GitHub using HTTPS (bonus: explain how to do it with SSH)
* compile the project
* open the project in your favorite IDE and talk about what's going on
* run the project and explain why the output is like it is

A co-worker that went on vacation left you a branch with work-in-progress

* switch to this branch
* explain and fix all errors you find (bonus: find out when and how the errors were introduced)
* run the project and explain why the output is like it is
